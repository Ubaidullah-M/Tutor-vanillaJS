# Tutor-vanillaJS

### Personal development
This is a personal development project, I made to solidify my front-end skill. I used HTML and vanilla CSS and javaScript to create it. The UI design of this project is a picture I come across on dribble and pinterest platform, and I made some changes and try to clone it.
I will also do the ReactJS version of this project soon.
The picture of the UI is attached in this repository.
